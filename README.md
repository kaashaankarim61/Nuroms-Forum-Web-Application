# Nuroms-Forum-Web-Application
Nuroms is a forum web application and aims to provide a vibrant online community, designed to bridge the gap between alumni, students, and faculty of our university and is built using the MERN Stack. This platform allows members to engage through posts, share knowledge, and stay updated on university happenings. Additionally, our dedicated online tutoring feature, integrated with Stripe for seamless payments, ensures a smooth and secure learning experience for students who are looking to get tutored by their seniors or faculty members.
